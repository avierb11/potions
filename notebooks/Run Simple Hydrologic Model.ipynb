It takes forcing data (like precipitation and temperature) as input and simulates how water moves through different stores (like snow, soil, and groundwater) to produce streamflow.\n",

These layers are composed of one or more \"zones\" (HydrologicZone), which act as individual computational units or conceptual buckets. Water moves between these zones both vertically, from an upper layer to the one below it, and laterally between zones within the same layer. The model calculates the complete water balance for each zone at every time step, simulating processes like infiltration, evapotranspiration, and runoff generation. For example, the HbvModel is structured with four distinct layers: a SnowZone at the top to accumulate and melt snow, a SoilZone beneath it to handle soil moisture, followed by a GroundZoneLinear for shallow groundwater, and finally a GroundZoneLinearB at the bottom representing a deep groundwater reservoir. This layered structure allows the model to simulate the sequential flow of water through the critical components of a catchment.\n"
